# 🧱 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome! This repository contains a scalable and modular data warehousing and analytics solution built using the **Medallion Architecture** — structured into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture**:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.  
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.  
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
